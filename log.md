# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: September 4, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Tackled true email uniqueness, including dealing with an issue where my email stuff was coming in from POST as null. Fun fact: that was my renaming a variable to email1 and not changing it elsewhere. Also made a note to make PHP check errors look like JS check errors for consistency.

**Thoughts:** It was tough to deal with PDO errors and array errors and missing variable errors before 9am, not being a morning person and all. Still, I put in a good hour and solved one of the issues I'd been facing. Will definitely need to double-check that I haven't broken anything, though.
